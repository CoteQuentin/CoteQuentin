- 👋 Hi, I’m @CoteQuentin
- 👀 I’m interested in all things software development, but currently my focus is on web development. Oh, and I also have a podcast 🎙 and am big into sci-fi 🛸, all other things technology 💾, and video games 🎮
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things web development. My GitHub serves as a centralized HQ for all of my projects. From my humble beginnings with an HTML-only "CV", to my Javascript Simon game, my projects illustrate my journey and showcase my progress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, I'm actually not the pickiest person. Currently I'm a dad to 2 little boys and work full time, so while I'd love nothing more than to dive into collaborative projects, I need to get the most out of what time I have, learning what I need to.
- 📫 If you insist on reaching out to me for a possible collaboration, or if you you're a prospective employer, don't be shy! You can reach me via email, at cotequentin.qc@gmail.com
